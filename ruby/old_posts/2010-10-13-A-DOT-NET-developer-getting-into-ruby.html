title: A .NET developer getting into Ruby
description: How I got to know Ruby and why I decided to explore it.

<div>
I probably got to know Ruby, and it’s Ruby on Rails framework, when I started to work with ASP .NET MVC, and while learning about the latter (it’s) architecture, structure and development paradigm, I discovered the similarities between the two frameworks (Ruby on Rails and ASP .NET MVC), has it had been suggested by one of my former co-workers at the company that I used to work at.

I’ve always worked with ASP .NET at my work, occasionally working with other server side technologies such as PHP or Python. About two years ago, we, at the company that I used to work at, decided to try this new framework, ASP .NET MVC, with (or in) some of the new projects.

We were delighted (excited) to explore new/old concepts (ex: MVC, convention over configuration), solution architecture (dynamic languages architectures), new/old development methodologies (ex: TDD) and to have control again over on what’s generated to client. I said new/old because none of these concepts is actually really ‘new’. They’ve been around for a while, fully supported in other frameworks, but you had to work your way around the framework in order to apply them. This time it’s little different. The framework itself enforces you to apply the concepts and best practices.

ASP .NET MVC is a lovely piece of software that allows you to build web applications based on the MVC software design pattern. The first versions of the framework were released late 2007 and the last stable version dates from March 2010. In an environment overcrowded with web forms, post backs, view states and code-behind(ed) views, it came as an alternative to what it was standard in the classic ASP .NET, by offering the developers the chance to gain control again over HTML and be able to generate clean view, with just pure HTML. Most of the times, with web forms, you don’t work directly with HTML, unless you want to re-invent the wheel. No more cumbersome pages with view state and strange id’s, and no obtrusive JavaScript, JavaScript integration (ex: Ajax, JQuery, JSON) is easy and clean. It also brought the following separation of concerns: views have no logic and only display information (presentation layer); controllers receive incoming requests and bridge the view with the model (middle layer); the model comprises the business rules and the data access (business and data access layer). These layers are totally independent allowing flexibility, when it comes to build and maintain the application, and testability.

<blockquote>
MVC is a software design pattern that defines project architecture in terms of a model-view-controller, the three key components of the design pattern.
The model contains the domain and the business rules of the application. It also has the data access (ORM).
The view is the presentation layer and is as dummy as it can get, for it’s only purpose is to display information returned from an interaction with the server.
The controller is the key layer that bridges the view with the model and receives incoming requests, redirecting them to the model and later returning the response to client with the selected view.
</blockquote>

The new framework also emphasized convention over configuration (I guess it’s self explained), dry and simple as possible solution, TDD (Test Driven Development) and Agile Development methodologies (ex: Scrum). It’s not like it’s something embedded in the framework when it comes to agile but there some details that make it easier to work your way with Agile such as ActiveRecord, Rails and Rake. These let you build and track changes in the application seemly. Another supported feature is REST.

Define REST
Define ActiveRecord

After working for a while with ASP .NET MVC, I decided to try both Ruby and Ruby on Rails. It felt natural in order to understand better the .NET MVC framework, and while I was at it, to try something new. Being both MVC frameworks was easy to understand its structure and workflow. The major difference came from the language itself, which I was unfamiliar with. Yet with a bit of reading and practice I was building already my first web applications with Ruby on Rails. I’m still working my way around ruby, while improving my way around with ASP .NET MVC, but I believe it won’t take too much time till start developing some decent applications with Ruby on Rails. I’ll be keeping you posted with my progress.
